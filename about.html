                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I love to try new things whenever I can. 
                    After playing soccer all my life, I decided to join the Men's Club Volleyball team at Colgate, and I've never looked back. 
                    Additionally, in my senior fall semester I decided to perform in the Nutcracker and try out ballet!
                    Plus, coming into college I had no intention of studying philosophy, but after experimenting with an intro class I fell in love with it and now I'm a philosophy minor!
                </p>
                <p>Some of my values include fairness, humor, and effort.
                    In philosophy, I've learned to understand all sides of an issue before casting judgments, and being thoughtful of others' mindsets and backgrounds.
                    I often use humor to develop new relationships, lead groups effectively, and generally live my life in the most positive mindset that I can!
                    Whether it's studying for an important test or undergoing physical training, I know that maximum effort equals maximum results, and I execute on this principle.
                </p>
