# My Website
## Built by Ronan Mullaney
### I built this website using HTML, some CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. 
#### My initial sprint was a 'getting started' sprint so to speak, where I learned the ins and outs of development with HTML and GitHub Pages.
#### After a 3-month break for school, I quickly went through a 'Bootstrap' sprint where I converted my self-made page styling to Bootstrap's style for efficiency and aesthetic
#### Then I went through my 'Content' sprint where I flushed out the content and descriptions on each page
##### Now that I have a minimal viable product, I will likely slow down on production.
